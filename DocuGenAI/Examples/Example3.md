# AzureDemo

## Overview

This project is an ASP.NET MVC web application designed as a demonstration for integrating various Microsoft Azure services. It showcases how to connect an ASP.NET application to different Azure data stores, providing practical examples of interacting with NoSQL databases, relational databases, and Azure Storage services. The application serves as a foundational example for developers looking to build cloud-native applications on Azure.

## Key Features

*   **ASP.NET MVC Web Interface:** A standard web application structure for user interaction and data presentation.
*   **Azure Cosmos DB Integration:** Demonstrates reading and potentially writing product data to Azure Cosmos DB.
*   **Azure Storage Integration:** Shows interaction with Azure Storage services, specifically hinting at Azure Queue Storage operations.
*   **Azure SQL Database Integration:** Connects to a relational database (likely Azure SQL Database) to manage and display product and customer-related data.
*   **Entity Framework Usage:** Utilizes an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for simplified data access to the SQL database.
*   **Modular Data Access:** Illustrates distinct data access patterns for different Azure services within a single application.

## Technologies Used

*   **Primary Language:** C#
*   **Web Framework:** ASP.NET MVC
*   **Platform:** .NET Framework
*   **Database (NoSQL):** Azure Cosmos DB
*   **Database (Relational):** Azure SQL Database (or SQL Server)
*   **ORM:** Entity Framework (or similar)
*   **Cloud Services:** Microsoft Azure Storage (Blobs, Queues, Tables)
*   **Package Management:** NuGet

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard ASP.NET MVC architecture, with additional components for Azure service integration:

*   `Controllers/`: Contains controller classes (`HomeController.cs`, `ProductsFromCosmosController.cs`) that handle user requests, interact with models, and return views.
*   `Models/`: Defines data models and business objects (`QueueSa.cs`, `ProductFromTable.cs`, `ProductsFromCosmos.cs`, `CustomerAddress.cs`, etc.) used throughout the application.
*   `Views/`: (Implied) Contains Razor view files responsible for rendering the user interface.
*   `App_Start/`: Configuration files for application startup, including `RouteConfig.cs` for URL routing.
*   `Global.asax.cs`: Handles application-level events, such as application startup and error logging.
*   `Web.config`: The main configuration file for the web application, including connection strings and application settings.
*   `Connected Services/`: Contains configuration related to connected Azure services, such as Azure Storage.
*   `AdventureSQL.cs`, `AdventureSQL.Designer.cs`: Files typically generated by an ORM (like Entity Framework) to define the database context and entities for the SQL database.
*   `HtmlExtensions.cs`: Likely contains custom HTML helper methods for use in Razor views.

## Installation/Setup

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Visual Studio (2019 or later recommended)
    *   .NET Framework (specific version as targeted by the project, usually 4.x)
    *   An active Azure subscription (for deploying and configuring Azure services).

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd AzureDemo
    ```

3.  **Restore NuGet Packages:**
    Open the solution in Visual Studio. NuGet packages should automatically restore. If not, right-click on the solution in Solution Explorer and select "Restore NuGet Packages".

4.  **Configure Azure Services:**
    *   **Azure Storage Account:** Create an Azure Storage Account (if you don't have one).
    *   **Azure Cosmos DB Account:** Create an Azure Cosmos DB account (SQL API recommended for this demo). Note down the connection string and database/collection names.
    *   **Azure SQL Database:** Create an Azure SQL Database. You might need to import the "AdventureWorks" sample database or create a compatible schema. Note down the connection string.

5.  **Update `Web.config`:**
    Open `Web.config` and update the connection strings and any other Azure-related configuration settings with your actual Azure resource details. Look for placeholders for:
    *   Azure Storage connection string.
    *   Azure Cosmos DB endpoint and key.
    *   Azure SQL Database connection string.

6.  **Build the Project:**
    Build the solution in Visual Studio (Build > Build Solution) to ensure all dependencies are resolved and the project compiles successfully.

7.  **Run the Application:**
    Press `F5` in Visual Studio to run the application in debug mode, or `Ctrl+F5` to run without debugging. This will launch the web application in your default browser.

## Usage

Once the application is running:

*   Navigate through the different sections of the application to observe its interaction with various Azure services.
*   Explore pages related to "Products from Cosmos" to see data retrieved from Azure Cosmos DB.
*   Check sections that interact with "Products from Table" or other SQL-related entities to see data from Azure SQL Database.
*   If queue operations are exposed, you can test sending/receiving messages via Azure Queue Storage.
*   Review the code in the `Controllers` and `Models` directories to understand how the Azure SDKs are used to perform operations against each service.

This application serves as an excellent starting point for understanding how to integrate and leverage Microsoft Azure services within an ASP.NET MVC application.
